In the context of pharmacology and drug development, "blood-brain barrier (BBB) active" and "inactive" refer to the ability of a molecule to cross the blood-brain barrier.

The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective semipermeable membrane that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. It's a crucial protective mechanism that prevents many substances, including drugs, from freely entering the brain.

BBB Active: Molecules that are considered BBB active have the ability to pass through the blood-brain barrier. This is important for drugs intended to treat conditions within the central nervous system (CNS), such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental health disorders. Medications for conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, and depression need to be BBB active to exert their effects on the brain.

BBB Inactive: Molecules that are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier are considered BBB inactive. These drugs primarily act outside the central nervous system, affecting other organs or systems in the body. They might target peripheral tissues or have effects that don't require direct interaction with the brain.

Developing drugs that are BBB active can be challenging due to the stringent barrier that the BBB presents. Many potential drug candidates might have properties that hinder their ability to pass through this barrier, which can limit their effectiveness in treating central nervous system disorders.

It's worth noting that sometimes, a drug may have partial BBB permeability, meaning it can cross the barrier to some extent but not entirely. This partial permeability might be sufficient for certain therapeutic effects.
